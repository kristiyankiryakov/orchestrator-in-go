The API wraps the worker’s functionality and exposes it as an HTTP
server, thus making it accessible over a network. This strategy of
exposing the worker’s functionality as a web API will allow the
manager to start and stop tasks, as well as query the state of tasks
across one or more workers.

The API is made up of handlers, routes, and a router. Handlers are
functions that accept a request and know how to process it and return
a response. Routes are patterns that can be used to match the URL of
incoming requests (e.g., /tasks). Finally, a router is the glue that
makes it all work by using the routes to route requests to the
handlers.

The API uses the standard HTTP methods like GET, POST, and
DELETE to define the operations that will occur for a given route. For
example, calling GET /tasks will return a list of tasks from the
worker.

While the API wraps the worker’s functionality, it does not interact
with that functionality itself. Instead, it simply performs some
administrative work and then places the task on the worker’s queue.
