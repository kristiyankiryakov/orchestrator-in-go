The worker exposes metrics about the state of the machine where it is
running. The metrics—about CPU, memory, and disk usage—will be used by
the manager to make scheduling decisions.

To make gathering metrics easier, we use a third-party library called
goprocinfo. This library handles most of the low-level work necessary to
get metrics from the /proc filesystem.

The metrics are made available on the same API that we built in chapter 5.
Thus, the manager will have a uniform way to interact with workers:
making HTTP calls to /tasks to perform task operations and making calls
to /stats to gather metrics about a worker’s current state.
