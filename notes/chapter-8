We wrapped the manager component in an API that allows users to
communicate with the manager.

We constructed the manager’s API using the same types of
components we used for the worker’s API: handlers, routes, and a
router.

The router listens for requests to the routes, and dispatches those
requests to the appropriate handlers.
